# ECommerce_StoreFront

The following project performs the functions of a simple Ecommerce system (like Amazon), which sells various types of products to registered customers.

The system keeps track of all registered customers, current orders, and shipped orders. It also allows multiple customers to add/remove items from 'wish list', view their cart, and order products. 

The code uses  Java Collections, File I/O and Exceptions, objects and classes, inheritance, and interfaces.
